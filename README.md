The Corporate Starter Kit project is primarily aimed at developers, as it showcases how a website can be scripted and created programmatically completely from scratch. Thus, the code examples in the kit are ideal for people who need to complete various tasks related to programmatic content and pages creation – for example, content migration scenarios,  testing, or simply taking advantages of the benefits provided by the powerful Sitefinity CMS API.

NOTE: The Corporate Starter Kit differs from the Quantum sample project, which demonstartes the out of the box capabilities of Sitefinity CMS. To explore the Quantum sample project, see [Quantum](https://github.com/Sitefinity-SDK/Telerik.Sitefinity.Samples.Quantum).



The Corporate Starter Kit is an online store build on the ECommerce module. You can browse the products available in the store and look at their descriptions. You can also go to the shop section and add products to your shopping cart. In the backend, you can edit the properties of all products available in the store. The starter kit comes with two language versions - English and Spanish.
